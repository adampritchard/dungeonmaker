TODO

- strange html comment <!--> in tab title during refresh

- game entities for player, create, key, door
  - move using tile co-ord not pixel co-ord

- smash crates with hammer?

- update utils/db.ts to not export db
  - instead export Users and Dungeons classes with methods like Users.findId(...) etc
  - Users class should return data with of type that excludes password 
    - https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/excluding-fields
  - don't refernce prisma User/Dungeon/etc types directly
  - can we move all uid encoding/decoding into the db layer? ie: Users.findByUid(...)

- keep track of which dungeons users have beaten

- 'share' snippet or button on edit/play page

- client shouldn't encode UID (don't send dungeon ID to client at all)
  - see Api.updateDungeon

- monitoring, probably with sentry
- tests, probably with jest and cypress

- publish dungeon
  - can prisma give me an enum type of Draft|Published|Archived ??

- would like a withRequiredSession function that auto 401s 
  - and rename the other to withOptionalSession
