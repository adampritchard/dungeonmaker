TODO

- link to share dungeon

- user page that lists their dungeons

- client shouldn't encode UID (don't send dungeon ID to client at all)
  - see Api.updateDungeon

- monitoring, probably with sentry
- tests, probably with jest and cypress

- publish dungeon
  - can prisma give me an enum type of Draft|Published|Archived ??

- would like a withRequiredSession function that auto 401s 
  - and rename the other to withOptionalSession
