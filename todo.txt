TODO

- user page that lists their dungeons

- update utils/db.ts to not export db
  - instead export Users and Dungeons classes with methods like Users.findId(...) etc
  - Users class should return data with of type that excludes password 
    - https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/excluding-fields

- 'share' snippet or button on edit/play page

- client shouldn't encode UID (don't send dungeon ID to client at all)
  - see Api.updateDungeon

- monitoring, probably with sentry
- tests, probably with jest and cypress

- publish dungeon
  - can prisma give me an enum type of Draft|Published|Archived ??

- would like a withRequiredSession function that auto 401s 
  - and rename the other to withOptionalSession
